# Arduino-As-FTDI

## Overview

This Arduino sketch employs the SoftwareSerial library provided by Arduino to emulate the functionality of a USB to serial converter. It essentially turns your Arduino into a bridge between a USB connection and a serial connection, enabling seamless communication between devices that utilize different interfaces. The sketch allows you to configure the following parameters:

- **RX and TX Pins:** Specify the pins on your Arduino that will be used for the software serial communication. These pins will act as the virtual RX (Receive) and TX (Transmit) pins for the serial communication.

- **Baud Rates:** Define the baud rates for both the USB and serial protocols. Baud rate is the speed at which data is transmitted over a communication channel. Consistent baud rates are crucial for reliable communication between devices.

## Configuration

1. Open the Arduino USB to Serial Converter sketch in your Arduino IDE.

2. Locate the configuration section in the sketch where you can set the following parameters:
   - `usbBaudRate`: Set the baud rate for the USB connection.
   - `serialBaudRate`: Set the baud rate for the serial communication.
   - `rxPin` and `txPin`: Specify the Arduino pins used for RX and TX communication.

3. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

4. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.

5. Use a USB-to-Serial terminal software on your computer to communicate with the target serial device. Configure the terminal software to match the `serialBaudRate`.

## Experience and Recommendations

The Arduino USB to Serial Converter sketch has been tested with an Arduino Nano board. The best results were achieved using a baud rate of 9600 for both the USB and serial communication protocols. During testing, the sketch was left running for several days without encountering any issues, indicating its stability and reliability for prolonged usage.

Please note that individual setups and hardware configurations may vary, so you might need to experiment with different baud rates and configurations to achieve optimal results for your specific use case.

## Disclaimer

While this project aims to provide an economical alternative to FTDI cables, it's important to recognize that Arduino boards and software serial libraries may not offer the same level of performance or features as dedicated FTDI hardware. This project is suitable for basic USB to serial conversion needs, but for applications with strict timing requirements or high data rates, using dedicated hardware solutions might be more appropriate.
